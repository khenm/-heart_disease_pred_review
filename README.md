# Heart Disease Prediction
## Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early detection and accurate prediction crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop and compare several machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the performanced of multiple machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction. The models considered included k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Stacking.
